"ODE is an open source, high performance library for simulating rigid body dynamics. It has advanced joint types and integrated collision detection with friction. ODE is useful for simulating vehicles, objects in virtual reality environments and virtual creatures. It is currently used in many computer games, 3D authoring tools and simulation tools. See http://www.ode.org/"

Forked from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HODE, then started cleaning it up and adding StateVar API to match both OpenGL and OpenAL and whatever else was missing.
